2.A Lightning web component is passing a value to a child component. Which decorator defines the variable in the child component?--@api
3.

6.Which function must be used for Apex Wire adapters in Jest tests?--createApexTestWireAdapter() from "@salesforce/wire-service-jest-utils";
7.Which statement is true about testing Base Lightning Components?--Best lightning componets have some properties that are not reflected as attributes in the DOM.
8.
What must be done to Jest tests to cause a module import statement inside a JavaScript file to resolve to the mocked version of this module?--Add the mocked module file to the moduleNameMapper settings in the jest.config file
9.Given a registered Apex wire adapter named findRecordsAdapter and a mocked @wire named mockRecords, which statement causes a Jest test to use the mocked records once the Apex method is called?--findRecordsAdapter.emit(mockRecords);
